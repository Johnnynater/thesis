just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.

ECC has now signed a Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA
and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.
 These deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away.
Please let me know if you have any questions on this.


Thanks
My good fren.
