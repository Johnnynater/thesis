An Irishman named O'Malley went to his doctor after a long illness.
the doctor, after a lengthy examination, sighed and looked O'Malley in the eye and said,
I've some bad news for you. You have cancer, and it can't be cured, you'd best put your affairs in order.
"oMalley was shocked and saddened; but of solid character, he managed to compose himself and walk from the doctor's office into the waiting room. "
To his son who had been waiting, O'Malley said, 
well son. We Irish celebrate when things are good, and we celebrate when things don't go so well. In this case, things aren't so well. I have cancer.
 Let's head for the pub and have a few pints 
after 3 or 4 pints, the two were feeling a little less somber. There were some laughs and more beers.
They were eventually approached by some of O'Malley's old friends who asked what the two were celebrating.
o'Malley told them that the Irish celebrate the good and the bad
He went on to tell them that they were drinking to his impending end
he told his friends, I have been diagnosed with AIDS.
The friends gave O'Malley their condolences, and they had a couple more beers. 
ffter his friends left, O'Malley's son whispered his confusion.
This joke goes on but i forgot how…
I think it was along the lines of:
But father, you have cancer right? Why lie to your friends about having aids?
and then the father would say something like
Becuase i don't want them to sleep with your mum 
when I'm gone.
